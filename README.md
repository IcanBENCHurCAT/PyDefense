PyDefense
=========
Tower defense game written in Python.
Thanks to the pytmx project for the Tiled level-loader

Version 0.2
===========
There is now a main screen, and two levels. If you lose, you can restart the level. If you win, you can move to the next level.
* Tab sends a new wave
* Spacebar speeds up the time when held
* Levels and enemies can now be configured via YAML files (to be expanded/refactored later)

Version 0.1
===========
Currently 'playable' but there is no way to win or lose. Press 'Tab' to add more spherenemies. 
Select units with '1', '2' or '3' and place them on the track. Units can be upgraded or sold for 
80% of their original value.
